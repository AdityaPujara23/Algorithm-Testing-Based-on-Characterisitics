What is this project about? 
This project attempts to test algorithms based on the size and nature (sorted or unsorted) of the dataset.

Which algorithms were tested?
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Insertion Sort
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort

Why is it useful?
● Time complexity is only an estimate, and as can be observed from this project, is not always the best representation of which algorithm would perform better for certain dataset characteristics
● Algorithmic efficiency has not been measured for the different sizes of datasets in such a manner
● For certain algorithms such as selection sort, the impact of whether the dataset is sorted or unsorted is very minor
● Algorithms of similar time complexities can perform differently

Where can I find the results? 
The results are available from the results.html file.
